in `/etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf`, add a line that says:
```# Docker all connections
host    all             all             172.16.0.0/12           md5```

in `/etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf`, uncomment the `listen_addresses` line, and change it to:
```listen_addresses = '127.0.0.1,172.17.0.1'               # what IP address(es) to listen on;```

Also, su to postgres user, create prefect user
```createuser prefect -s -P```
NOTE: This creates the prefect user as a postgres superuser. That's a shame, but it's needed to allow hasura to install
the various pg extensions it wants.

Create a db, owned by prefect:
```createdb -O prefect prefect```
