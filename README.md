settings used to install Prefect in a k8s cluster.

These are both installed via helm, so the kubernetes directory holds the values.yaml overrides to the default
helm settings for both prefect and postgresql.

The "prefect-db-setup-job" is a one-off k8s job to create the prefect username and db in postgres and a prefect
user in elasticsearch.
